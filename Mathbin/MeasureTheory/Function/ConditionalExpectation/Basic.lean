/-! # Conditional expectation

We build the conditional expectation of an integrable function `f` with value in a Banach space
with respect to a measure `μ` (defined on a measurable space structure `m0`) and a measurable space
structure `m` with `hm : m ≤ m0` (a sub-sigma-algebra). This is an `m`-strongly measurable
function `μ[f|hm]` which is integrable and verifies `∫ x in s, μ[f|hm] x ∂μ = ∫ x in s, f x ∂μ`
for all `m`-measurable sets `s`. It is unique as an element of `L¹`.

The construction is done in four steps:
* Define the conditional expectation of an `L²` function, as an element of `L²`. This is the
  orthogonal projection on the subspace of almost everywhere `m`-measurable functions.
* Show that the conditional expectation of the indicator of a measurable set with finite measure
  is integrable and define a map `set α → (E →L[ℝ] (α →₁[μ] E))` which to a set associates a linear
  map. That linear map sends `x ∈ E` to the conditional expectation of the indicator of the set
  with value `x`.
* Extend that map to `condexp_L1_clm : (α →₁[μ] E) →L[ℝ] (α →₁[μ] E)`. This is done using the same
  construction as the Bochner integral (see the file `measure_theory/integral/set_to_L1`).
* Define the conditional expectation of a function `f : α → E`, which is an integrable function
  `α → E` equal to 0 if `f` is not integrable, and equal to an `m`-measurable representative of
  `condexp_L1_clm` applied to `[f]`, the equivalence class of `f` in `L¹`.

## Main results

The conditional expectation and its properties

* `condexp (m : measurable_space α) (μ : measure α) (f : α → E)`: conditional expectation of `f`
  with respect to `m`.
* `integrable_condexp` : `condexp` is integrable.
* `strongly_measurable_condexp` : `condexp` is `m`-strongly-measurable.
* `set_integral_condexp (hf : integrable f μ) (hs : measurable_set[m] s)` : if `m ≤ m0` (the
  σ-algebra over which the measure is defined), then the conditional expectation verifies
  `∫ x in s, condexp m μ f x ∂μ = ∫ x in s, f x ∂μ` for any `m`-measurable set `s`.

While `condexp` is function-valued, we also define `condexp_L1` with value in `L1` and a continuous
linear map `condexp_L1_clm` from `L1` to `L1`. `condexp` should be used in most cases.

Uniqueness of the conditional expectation

* `Lp.ae_eq_of_forall_set_integral_eq'`: two `Lp` functions verifying the equality of integrals
  defining the conditional expectation are equal.
* `ae_eq_of_forall_set_integral_eq_of_sigma_finite'`: two functions verifying the equality of
  integrals defining the conditional expectation are equal almost everywhere.
  Requires `[sigma_finite (μ.trim hm)]`.
* `ae_eq_condexp_of_forall_set_integral_eq`: an a.e. `m`-measurable function which verifies the
  equality of integrals is a.e. equal to `condexp`.

## Notations

For a measure `μ` defined on a measurable space structure `m0`, another measurable space structure
`m` with `hm : m ≤ m0` (a sub-σ-algebra) and a function `f`, we define the notation
* `μ[f|m] = condexp m μ f`.

## Implementation notes

Most of the results in this file are valid for a complete real normed space `F`.
However, some lemmas also use `𝕜 : is_R_or_C`:
* `condexp_L2` is defined only for an `inner_product_space` for now, and we use `𝕜` for its field.
* results about scalar multiplication are stated not only for `ℝ` but also for `𝕜` if we happen to
  have `normed_space 𝕜 F`.

/-! ## Conditional expectation of an indicator as a continuous linear map.

The goal of this section is to build
`condexp_ind (hm : m ≤ m0) (μ : measure α) (s : set s) : G →L[ℝ] α →₁[μ] G`, which
takes `x : G` to the conditional expectation of the indicator of the set `s` with value `x`,
seen as an element of `α →₁[μ] G`.
