# Sheaves of types on a Grothendieck topology

Defines the notion of a sheaf of types (usually called a sheaf of sets by mathematicians)
on a category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, as well as a range of equivalent
conditions useful in different situations.

First define what it means for a presheaf `P : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v` to be a sheaf *for* a particular
presieve `R` on `X`:
* A *family of elements* `x` for `P` at `R` is an element `x_f` of `P Y` for every `f : Y ⟶ X` in
  `R`. See `family_of_elements`.
* The family `x` is *compatible* if, for any `f₁ : Y₁ ⟶ X` and `f₂ : Y₂ ⟶ X` both in `R`,
  and any `g₁ : Z ⟶ Y₁` and `g₂ : Z ⟶ Y₂` such that `g₁ ≫ f₁ = g₂ ≫ f₂`, the restriction of
  `x_f₁` along `g₁` agrees with the restriction of `x_f₂` along `g₂`.
  See `family_of_elements.compatible`.
* An *amalgamation* `t` for the family is an element of `P X` such that for every `f : Y ⟶ X` in
  `R`, the restriction of `t` on `f` is `x_f`.
  See `family_of_elements.is_amalgamation`.
We then say `P` is *separated* for `R` if every compatible family has at most one amalgamation,
and it is a *sheaf* for `R` if every compatible family has a unique amalgamation.
See `is_separated_for` and `is_sheaf_for`.

In the special case where `R` is a sieve, the compatibility condition can be simplified:
* The family `x` is *compatible* if, for any `f : Y ⟶ X` in `R` and `g : Z ⟶ Y`, the restriction of
  `x_f` along `g` agrees with `x_(g ≫ f)` (which is well defined since `g ≫ f` is in `R`).
See `family_of_elements.sieve_compatible` and `compatible_iff_sieve_compatible`.

In the special case where `C` has pullbacks, the compatibility condition can be simplified:
* The family `x` is *compatible* if, for any `f : Y ⟶ X` and `g : Z ⟶ X` both in `R`,
  the restriction of `x_f` along `π₁ : pullback f g ⟶ Y` agrees with the restriction of `x_g`
  along `π₂ : pullback f g ⟶ Z`.
See `family_of_elements.pullback_compatible` and `pullback_compatible_iff`.

Now given a Grothendieck topology `J`, `P` is a sheaf if it is a sheaf for every sieve in the
topology. See `is_sheaf`.

In the case where the topology is generated by a basis, it suffices to check `P` is a sheaf for
every presieve in the pretopology. See `is_sheaf_pretopology`.

We also provide equivalent conditions to satisfy alternate definitions given in the literature.

* Stacks: In `equalizer.presieve.sheaf_condition`, the sheaf condition at a presieve is shown to be
  equivalent to that of https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00VM (and combined with
  `is_sheaf_pretopology`, this shows the notions of `is_sheaf` are exactly equivalent.)

  The condition of https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00Z8 is virtually identical to the
  statement of `yoneda_condition_iff_sheaf_condition` (since the bijection described there carries
  the same information as the unique existence.)

* Maclane-Moerdijk [MM92]: Using `compatible_iff_sieve_compatible`, the definitions of `is_sheaf`
  are equivalent. There are also alternate definitions given:
  - Yoneda condition: Defined in `yoneda_sheaf_condition` and equivalence in
    `yoneda_condition_iff_sheaf_condition`.
  - Equalizer condition (Equation 3): Defined in the `equalizer.sieve` namespace, and equivalence
    in `equalizer.sieve.sheaf_condition`.
  - Matching family for presieves with pullback: `pullback_compatible_iff`.
  - Sheaf for a pretopology (Prop 1): `is_sheaf_pretopology` combined with the previous.
  - Sheaf for a pretopology as equalizer (Prop 1, bis): `equalizer.presieve.sheaf_condition`
    combined with the previous.

## Implementation

The sheaf condition is given as a proposition, rather than a subsingleton in `Type (max u₁ v)`.
This doesn't seem to make a big difference, other than making a couple of definitions noncomputable,
but it means that equivalent conditions can be given as `↔` statements rather than `≃` statements,
which can be convenient.

A family of elements for a presheaf `P` given a collection of arrows `R` with fixed codomain `X`
consists of an element of `P Y` for every `f : Y ⟶ X` in `R`.
A presheaf is a sheaf (resp, separated) if every *compatible* family of elements has exactly one
(resp, at most one) amalgamation.

This data is referred to as a `family` in [MM92], Chapter III, Section 4. It is also a concrete
version of the elements of the middle object in https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00VM which is
more useful for direct calculations. It is also used implicitly in Definition C2.1.2 in [Elephant].

/--
A family of elements for the arrow set `R` is *compatible* if for any `f₁ : Y₁ ⟶ X` and
`f₂ : Y₂ ⟶ X` in `R`, and any `g₁ : Z ⟶ Y₁` and `g₂ : Z ⟶ Y₂`, if the square `g₁ ≫ f₁ = g₂ ≫ f₂`
commutes then the elements of `P Z` obtained by restricting the element of `P Y₁` along `g₁` and
restricting the element of `P Y₂` along `g₂` are the same.

In special cases, this condition can be simplified, see `pullback_compatible_iff` and
`compatible_iff_sieve_compatible`.

This is referred to as a "compatible family" in Definition C2.1.2 of [Elephant], and on nlab:

    g₁ ≫ f₁ = g₂ ≫ f₂ → P.map g₁.op (x f₁ h₁) = P.map g₂.op (x f₂ h₂)

/--
If the category `C` has pullbacks, this is an alternative condition for a family of elements to be
compatible: For any `f : Y ⟶ X` and `g : Z ⟶ X` in the presieve `R`, the restriction of the
given elements for `f` and `g` to the pullback agree.
This is equivalent to being compatible (provided `C` has pullbacks), shown in
`pullback_compatible_iff`.

This is the definition for a "matching" family given in [MM92], Chapter III, Section 4,
Equation (5). Viewing the type `family_of_elements` as the middle object of the fork in
https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00VM, this condition expresses that `pr₀* (x) = pr₁* (x)`,
using the notation defined there.

We define `P` to be a sheaf for the presieve `R` if every compatible family has a unique
amalgamation.

This is the definition of a sheaf for the given presieve given in C2.1.2 of [Elephant], and
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf#GeneralDefinitionInComponents.
Using `compatible_iff_sieve_compatible`,
this is equivalent to the definition of a sheaf in [MM92], Chapter III, Section 4.

/--
This is an equivalent condition to be a sheaf, which is useful for the abstraction to local
operators on elementary toposes. However this definition is defined only for sieves, not presieves.
The equivalence between this and `is_sheaf_for` is given in `yoneda_condition_iff_sheaf_condition`.
This version is also useful to establish that being a sheaf is preserved under isomorphism of
presheaves.

See the discussion before Equation (3) of [MM92], Chapter III, Section 4. See also C2.1.4 of
[Elephant]. This is also a direct reformulation of https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00Z8.

(Implementation). This is a (primarily internal) equivalence between natural transformations
