# The Fréchet derivative

Let `E` and `F` be normed spaces, `f : E → F`, and `f' : E →L[𝕜] F` a
continuous 𝕜-linear map, where `𝕜` is a non-discrete normed field. Then

  `has_fderiv_within_at f f' s x`

says that `f` has derivative `f'` at `x`, where the domain of interest
is restricted to `s`. We also have

  `has_fderiv_at f f' x := has_fderiv_within_at f f' x univ`

Finally,

  `has_strict_fderiv_at f f' x`

means that `f : E → F` has derivative `f' : E →L[𝕜] F` in the sense of strict differentiability,
i.e., `f y - f z - f'(y - z) = o(y - z)` as `y, z → x`. This notion is used in the inverse
function theorem, and is defined here only to avoid proving theorems like
`is_bounded_bilinear_map.has_fderiv_at` twice: first for `has_fderiv_at`, then for
`has_strict_fderiv_at`.

## Main results

In addition to the definition and basic properties of the derivative, this file contains the
usual formulas (and existence assertions) for the derivative of
* constants
* the identity
* bounded linear maps
* bounded bilinear maps
* sum of two functions
* sum of finitely many functions
* multiplication of a function by a scalar constant
* negative of a function
* subtraction of two functions
* multiplication of a function by a scalar function
* multiplication of two scalar functions
* composition of functions (the chain rule)
* inverse function (assuming that it exists; the inverse function theorem is in `inverse.lean`)

For most binary operations we also define `const_op` and `op_const` theorems for the cases when
the first or second argument is a constant. This makes writing chains of `has_deriv_at`'s easier,
and they more frequently lead to the desired result.

One can also interpret the derivative of a function `f : 𝕜 → E` as an element of `E` (by identifying
a linear function from `𝕜` to `E` with its value at `1`). Results on the Fréchet derivative are
translated to this more elementary point of view on the derivative in the file `deriv.lean`. The
derivative of polynomials is handled there, as it is naturally one-dimensional.

The simplifier is set up to prove automatically that some functions are differentiable, or
differentiable at a point (but not differentiable on a set or within a set at a point, as checking
automatically that the good domains are mapped one to the other when using composition is not
something the simplifier can easily do). This means that one can write
`example (x : ℝ) : differentiable ℝ (λ x, sin (exp (3 + x^2)) - 5 * cos x) := by simp`.
If there are divisions, one needs to supply to the simplifier proofs that the denominators do
not vanish, as in
```lean
example (x : ℝ) (h : 1 + sin x ≠ 0) : differentiable_at ℝ (λ x, exp x / (1 + sin x)) x :=
by simp [h]
```
Of course, these examples only work once `exp`, `cos` and `sin` have been shown to be
differentiable, in `analysis.special_functions.trigonometric`.

The simplifier is not set up to compute the Fréchet derivative of maps (as these are in general
complicated multidimensional linear maps), but it will compute one-dimensional derivatives,
see `deriv.lean`.

## Implementation details

The derivative is defined in terms of the `is_o` relation, but also
characterized in terms of the `tendsto` relation.

We also introduce predicates `differentiable_within_at 𝕜 f s x` (where `𝕜` is the base field,
`f` the function to be differentiated, `x` the point at which the derivative is asserted to exist,
and `s` the set along which the derivative is defined), as well as `differentiable_at 𝕜 f x`,
`differentiable_on 𝕜 f s` and `differentiable 𝕜 f` to express the existence of a derivative.

To be able to compute with derivatives, we write `fderiv_within 𝕜 f s x` and `fderiv 𝕜 f x`
for some choice of a derivative if it exists, and the zero function otherwise. This choice only
behaves well along sets for which the derivative is unique, i.e., those for which the tangent
directions span a dense subset of the whole space. The predicates `unique_diff_within_at s x` and
`unique_diff_on s`, defined in `tangent_cone.lean` express this property. We prove that indeed
they imply the uniqueness of the derivative. This is satisfied for open subsets, and in particular
for `univ`. This uniqueness only holds when the field is non-discrete, which we request at the very
beginning: otherwise, a derivative can be defined, but it has no interesting properties whatsoever.

To make sure that the simplifier can prove automatically that functions are differentiable, we tag
many lemmas with the `simp` attribute, for instance those saying that the sum of differentiable
functions is differentiable, as well as their product, their cartesian product, and so on. A notable
exception is the chain rule: we do not mark as a simp lemma the fact that, if `f` and `g` are
differentiable, then their composition also is: `simp` would always be able to match this lemma,
by taking `f` or `g` to be the identity. Instead, for every reasonable function (say, `exp`),
we add a lemma that if `f` is differentiable then so is `(λ x, exp (f x))`. This means adding
some boilerplate lemmas, but these can also be useful in their own right.

Tests for this ability of the simplifier (with more examples) are provided in
`tests/differentiable.lean`.

    If a function f has a derivative f' at x, a rescaled version of f around x converges to f',
    i.e., `n (f (x + (1/n) v) - f x)` converges to `f' v`. More generally, if `c n` tends to infinity
    and `c n * d n` tends to `v`, then `c n * (f (x + d n) - f x)` tends to `f' v`. This lemma expresses
    this fact, for functions having a derivative within a set. Its specific formulation is useful for
    tangent cone related discussions. -/

### Derivatives of functions `f : E → Π i, F' i`

In this section we formulate `has_*fderiv*_pi` theorems as `iff`s, and provide two versions of each
theorem:

* the version without `'` deals with `φ : Π i, E → F' i` and `φ' : Π i, E →L[𝕜] F' i`
  and is designed to deduce differentiability of `λ x i, φ i x` from differentiability
  of each `φ i`;
* the version with `'` deals with `Φ : E → Π i, F' i` and `Φ' : E →L[𝕜] Π i, F' i`
  and is designed to deduce differentiability of the components `λ x, Φ x i` from
  differentiability of `Φ`.

/-! ### Derivative of the product of a scalar-valued function and a vector-valued function

If `c` is a differentiable scalar-valued function and `f` is a differentiable vector-valued
function, then `λ x, c x • f x` is differentiable as well. Lemmas in this section works for
function `c` taking values in the base field, as well as in a normed algebra over the base
field: e.g., they work for `c : E → ℂ` and `f : E → F` provided that `F` is a complex
normed vector space.

### Restricting from `ℂ` to `ℝ`, or generally from `𝕜'` to `𝕜`

If a function is differentiable over `ℂ`, then it is differentiable over `ℝ`. In this paragraph,
we give variants of this statement, in the general situation where `ℂ` and `ℝ` are replaced
respectively by `𝕜'` and `𝕜` where `𝕜'` is a normed algebra over `𝕜`.
