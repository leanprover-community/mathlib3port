# Fiber bundles

A topological fiber bundle with fiber `F` over a base `B` is a space projecting on `B` for which the
fibers are all homeomorphic to `F`, such that the local situation around each point is a direct
product. We define a predicate `is_topological_fiber_bundle F p` saying that `p : Z → B` is a
topological fiber bundle with fiber `F`.

It is in general nontrivial to construct a fiber bundle. A way is to start from the knowledge of
how changes of local trivializations act on the fiber. From this, one can construct the total space
of the bundle and its topology by a suitable gluing construction. The main content of this file is
an implementation of this construction: starting from an object of type
`topological_fiber_bundle_core` registering the trivialization changes, one gets the corresponding
fiber bundle and projection.

Similarly we implement the object `topological_fiber_prebundle` which allows to define a topological
fiber bundle from trivializations given as local equivalences with minimum additional properties.

## Main definitions

### Basic definitions

* `trivialization F p` : structure extending local homeomorphisms, defining a local
                  trivialization of a topological space `Z` with projection `p` and fiber `F`.

* `is_topological_fiber_bundle F p` : Prop saying that the map `p` between topological spaces is a
                  fiber bundle with fiber `F`.

* `is_trivial_topological_fiber_bundle F p` : Prop saying that the map `p : Z → B` between
  topological spaces is a trivial topological fiber bundle, i.e., there exists a homeomorphism
  `h : Z ≃ₜ B × F` such that `proj x = (h x).1`.

### Operations on bundles

We provide the following operations on `trivialization`s.

* `trivialization.comap`: given a local trivialization `e` of a fiber bundle `p : Z → B`, a
  continuous map `f : B' → B` and a point `b' : B'` such that `f b' ∈ e.base_set`,
  `e.comap f hf b' hb'` is a trivialization of the pullback bundle. The pullback bundle
  (a.k.a., the induced bundle) has total space `{(x, y) : B' × Z | f x = p y}`, and is given by
  `λ ⟨(x, y), h⟩, x`.

* `is_topological_fiber_bundle.comap`: if `p : Z → B` is a topological fiber bundle, then its
  pullback along a continuous map `f : B' → B` is a topological fiber bundle as well.

* `trivialization.comp_homeomorph`: given a local trivialization `e` of a fiber bundle
  `p : Z → B` and a homeomorphism `h : Z' ≃ₜ Z`, returns a local trivialization of the fiber bundle
  `p ∘ h`.

* `is_topological_fiber_bundle.comp_homeomorph`: if `p : Z → B` is a topological fiber bundle
  and `h : Z' ≃ₜ Z` is a homeomorphism, then `p ∘ h : Z' → B` is a topological fiber bundle with
  the same fiber.

### Construction of a bundle from trivializations

* `bundle.total_space E` is a type synonym for `Σ (x : B), E x`, that we can endow with a suitable
  topology.
* `topological_fiber_bundle_core ι B F` : structure registering how changes of coordinates act
  on the fiber `F` above open subsets of `B`, where local trivializations are indexed by `ι`.

Let `Z : topological_fiber_bundle_core ι B F`. Then we define

* `Z.fiber x`     : the fiber above `x`, homeomorphic to `F` (and defeq to `F` as a type).
* `Z.total_space` : the total space of `Z`, defined as a `Type` as `Σ (b : B), F`, but with a
  twisted topology coming from the fiber bundle structure. It is (reducibly) the same as
  `bundle.total_space Z.fiber`.
* `Z.proj`        : projection from `Z.total_space` to `B`. It is continuous.
* `Z.local_triv i`: for `i : ι`, bundle trivialization above the set `Z.base_set i`, which is an
                    open set in `B`.

* `pretrivialization F proj` : trivialization as a local equivalence, mainly used when the
                                      topology on the total space has not yet been defined.
* `topological_fiber_prebundle F proj` : structure registering a cover of prebundle trivializations
  and requiring that the relative transition maps are local homeomorphisms.
* `topological_fiber_prebundle.total_space_topology a` : natural topology of the total space, making
  the prebundle into a bundle.

## Implementation notes

A topological fiber bundle with fiber `F` over a base `B` is a family of spaces isomorphic to `F`,
indexed by `B`, which is locally trivial in the following sense: there is a covering of `B` by open
sets such that, on each such open set `s`, the bundle is isomorphic to `s × F`.

To construct a fiber bundle formally, the main data is what happens when one changes trivializations
from `s × F` to `s' × F` on `s ∩ s'`: one should get a family of homeomorphisms of `F`, depending
continuously on the base point, satisfying basic compatibility conditions (cocycle property).
Useful classes of bundles can then be specified by requiring that these homeomorphisms of `F`
belong to some subgroup, preserving some structure (the "structure group of the bundle"): then
these structures are inherited by the fibers of the bundle.

Given such trivialization change data (encoded below in a structure called
`topological_fiber_bundle_core`), one can construct the fiber bundle. The intrinsic canonical
mathematical construction is the following.
The fiber above `x` is the disjoint union of `F` over all trivializations, modulo the gluing
identifications: one gets a fiber which is isomorphic to `F`, but non-canonically
(each choice of one of the trivializations around `x` gives such an isomorphism). Given a
trivialization over a set `s`, one gets an isomorphism between `s × F` and `proj^{-1} s`, by using
the identification corresponding to this trivialization. One chooses the topology on the bundle that
makes all of these into homeomorphisms.

For the practical implementation, it turns out to be more convenient to avoid completely the
gluing and quotienting construction above, and to declare above each `x` that the fiber is `F`,
but thinking that it corresponds to the `F` coming from the choice of one trivialization around `x`.
This has several practical advantages:
* without any work, one gets a topological space structure on the fiber. And if `F` has more
structure it is inherited for free by the fiber.
* In the case of the tangent bundle of manifolds, this implies that on vector spaces the derivative
(from `F` to `F`) and the manifold derivative (from `tangent_space I x` to `tangent_space I' (f x)`)
are equal.

A drawback is that some silly constructions will typecheck: in the case of the tangent bundle, one
can add two vectors in different tangent spaces (as they both are elements of `F` from the point of
view of Lean). To solve this, one could mark the tangent space as irreducible, but then one would
lose the identification of the tangent space to `F` with `F`. There is however a big advantage of
this situation: even if Lean can not check that two basepoints are defeq, it will accept the fact
that the tangent spaces are the same. For instance, if two maps `f` and `g` are locally inverse to
each other, one can express that the composition of their derivatives is the identity of
`tangent_space I x`. One could fear issues as this composition goes from `tangent_space I x` to
`tangent_space I (g (f x))` (which should be the same, but should not be obvious to Lean
as it does not know that `g (f x) = x`). As these types are the same to Lean (equal to `F`), there
are in fact no dependent type difficulties here!

For this construction of a fiber bundle from a `topological_fiber_bundle_core`, we should thus
choose for each `x` one specific trivialization around it. We include this choice in the definition
of the `topological_fiber_bundle_core`, as it makes some constructions more
functorial and it is a nice way to say that the trivializations cover the whole space `B`.

With this definition, the type of the fiber bundle space constructed from the core data is just
`Σ (b : B), F `, but the topology is not the product one, in general.

We also take the indexing type (indexing all the trivializations) as a parameter to the fiber bundle
core: it could always be taken as a subtype of all the maps from open subsets of `B` to continuous
maps of `F`, but in practice it will sometimes be something else. For instance, on a manifold, one
will use the set of charts as a good parameterization for the trivializations of the tangent bundle.
Or for the pullback of a `topological_fiber_bundle_core`, the indexing type will be the same as
for the initial bundle.

/--  Core data defining a locally trivial topological bundle with fiber `F` over a topological
space `B`. Note that "bundle" is used in its mathematical sense. This is the (computer science)
bundled version, i.e., all the relevant data is contained in the following structure. A family of
local trivializations is indexed by a type `ι`, on open subsets `base_set i` for each `i : ι`.
Trivialization changes from `i` to `j` are given by continuous maps `coord_change i j` from
`base_set i ∩ base_set j` to the set of homeomorphisms of `F`, but we express them as maps
`B → F → F` and require continuity on `(base_set i ∩ base_set j) × F` to avoid the topology on the
space of continuous maps on `F`. -/

/--  Associate to a trivialization index `i : ι` the corresponding trivialization, i.e., a bijection
between `proj ⁻¹ (base_set i)` and `base_set i × F`. As the fiber above `x` is `F` but read in the
chart with index `index_at x`, the trivialization in the fiber above x is by definition the
coordinate change from i to `index_at x`, so it depends on `x`.
The local trivialization will ultimately be a local homeomorphism. For now, we only introduce the
local equiv version, denoted with a prime. In further developments, avoid this auxiliary version,
