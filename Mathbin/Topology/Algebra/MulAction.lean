# Continuous monoid action

In this file we define class `has_continuous_smul`. We say `has_continuous_smul M α` if `M` acts on
`α` and the map `(c, x) ↦ c • x` is continuous on `M × α`. We reuse this class for topological
(semi)modules, vector spaces and algebras.

## Main definitions

* `has_continuous_smul M α` : typeclass saying that the map `(c, x) ↦ c • x` is continuous
  on `M × α`;
* `homeomorph.smul_of_ne_zero`: if a group with zero `G₀` (e.g., a field) acts on `α` and `c : G₀`
  is a nonzero element of `G₀`, then scalar multiplication by `c` is a homeomorphism of `α`;
* `homeomorph.smul`: scalar multiplication by an element of a group `G` acting on `α`
  is a homeomorphism of `α`.
* `units.has_continuous_smul`: scalar multiplication by `Mˣ` is continuous when scalar
  multiplication by `M` is continuous. This allows `homeomorph.smul` to be used with on monoids
  with `G = Mˣ`.

## Main results

Besides homeomorphisms mentioned above, in this file we provide lemmas like `continuous.smul`
or `filter.tendsto.smul` that provide dot-syntax access to `continuous_smul`.
