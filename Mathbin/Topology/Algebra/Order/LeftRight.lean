# Left and right continuity

In this file we prove a few lemmas about left and right continuous functions:

* `continuous_within_at_Ioi_iff_Ici`: two definitions of right continuity
  (with `(a, ∞)` and with `[a, ∞)`) are equivalent;
* `continuous_within_at_Iio_iff_Iic`: two definitions of left continuity
  (with `(-∞, a)` and with `(-∞, a]`) are equivalent;
* `continuous_at_iff_continuous_left_right`, `continuous_at_iff_continuous_left'_right'` :
  a function is continuous at `a` if and only if it is left and right continuous at `a`.
